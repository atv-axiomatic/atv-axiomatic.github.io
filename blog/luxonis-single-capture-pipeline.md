While there seem to be plenty of guides on how to perform object detection on video, there isn't a tutorial that walks through a single image capture pipeline. This tutorial will walk through how to use the Luxonis SDK paired with the Oak-D-Lite (however I believe any Oak-D series will suffice) to create a single image capture pipeline for a Neural Network model.

## What you'll need:

- An Oak-D series camera
- A Neural Network model in a blob format

Let's jump straight into the nitty gritty here:
